I created this repository for implementing linear and binary both searches in one code so that it often makes a way more easier to apply searching algorithms if inputs are on unsorted array then use linear search and the dynamically program allows yall to enter size of an array as per user wish and a menu driven application makes it more specific to use 2 searching algortihms at one code as the name mentioned in the respository
